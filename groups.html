      <h1>Blood groups</h1>
      <p>There are 4 main blood groups (types of blood) â€“ A, B, AB and O. Your blood group is determined by the genes you inherit from your parents.</p>
      <p>Each group can be either RhD positive or RhD negative, which means in total there are 8 blood groups.</p>
      <h2>Antibodies and antigens</h2>
      <p>Blood is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in a liquid called plasma. Your blood group is identified by antibodies and antigens in the blood.</p>
      <p>Antibodies are proteins found in plasma. They're part of your body's natural defences. They recognise foreign substances, such as germs, and alert your immune system, which destroys them.</p>
      <p>Antigens are protein molecules found on the surface of red blood cells.</p>
      <h1>The ABO system</h1>
      <h3>There are 4 main blood groups defined by the ABO system:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blood Group A:</strong> A antigens on the red blood cells, anti-B antibodies in the plasma.</li>
            <li><strong>Blood Group B:</strong> B antigens on the red blood cells, anti-A antibodies in the plasma.</li>
            <li><strong>Blood Group O:</strong> No antigens on the red blood cells, both anti-A and anti-B antibodies in the plasma.</li>
            <li><strong>Blood Group AB:</strong> Both A and B antigens on the red blood cells, no antibodies in the plasma.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Receiving blood from the wrong ABO group can be life-threatening. For example, if someone with group B blood is given group A blood, their anti-A antibodies will attack the group A cells.</p>
        <p>This is why group A blood must never be given to someone who has group B blood and vice versa.</p>
        <p>As group O red blood cells do not have any A or B antigens, it can safely be given to any other group.</p>
  
        <h2>The Rh system</h2>
        <p>Red blood cells sometimes have another antigen, a protein known as the RhD antigen. If this is present, your blood group is RhD positive. If it's absent, your blood group is RhD negative.</p>
        <p>This means you can be 1 of 8 blood groups:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A RhD positive (A+)</li>
            <li>A RhD negative (A-)</li>
            <li>B RhD positive (B+)</li>
            <li>B RhD negative (B-)</li>
            <li>O RhD positive (O+)</li>
            <li>O RhD negative (O-)</li>
            <li>AB RhD positive (AB+)</li>
            <li>AB RhD negative (AB-)</li>
          </ul>

        <p>In most cases, O RhD negative blood (O-) can safely be given to anyone. It's often used in medical emergencies when the blood type is not immediately known.</p>
        <p>It's safe for most recipients because it does not have any A, B or RhD antigens on the surface of the cells, and is compatible with every other ABO and RhD blood group.</p>
        <h3>Blood group test</h3>
        <p>To work out your blood group, your red blood cells are mixed with different antibody solutions. If, for example, the solution contains anti-B antibodies and you have B antigens on your cells (you're blood group B), it will clump together.</P>
        <p>If the blood does not react to any of the anti-A or anti-B antibodies, it's blood group O. A series of tests with different types of antibody can be used to identify your blood group.</P>
        <h3>Pregnancy</h3>
        <p>Pregnant women are always given a blood group test. This is because if the mother is RhD negative but the child has inherited RhD-positive blood from the father, it could cause complications if left untreated.</p>
        <p>RhD-negative women of child-bearing age should always only receive RhD-negative blood.</p>
        <h2>Giving blood</h2>
        <p>You can usually donate blood if you:</p>
           <ul>
            <li>are fit and healthy</li>
            <li>weigh between 50kg (7st 12lb) and 158kg (25st)</li>
            <li>are 17 to 65 years old</li>
           </ul>
